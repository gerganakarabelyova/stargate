Stargate graphics is a blog-like website, dedicated to a hobby of mine - creating graphics, gifs, small videos and wallpapers with Adobe Photoshop. The graphics uploaded here are all about a military science-fiction TV show called "Stargate" that I used to like when I was in high school. I made the original website in 2010, but I went through it again and optimized it in 2017.
